## User Stories (MVP)
**USER**
- As a user, I want to vote on 3 interesting images quickly and easily, without any repetitions.
- As a user, I want instruction on what action to take, so I know what to do.
- As a user, I want the site to be simple and easy to use, so that I enjoy my voting experience.
- As a user, I want the site to be responsive so that I do not need to scroll to see all three options.
- As a user, I want to see the results of my survey in a list or table format, so I can know which ones were my favorite.
- As a user, I want visual feedback on my choices, so that I know my actions are being logged.
- As a user, I don't want to spend too long on the survey. A progress bar would be helpful.

**DEVELOPER**
- As a developer, I want images sized appropriately so that all the pictures are uniformly scaled.
- As a developer, I want all 3 images displayed to be different so that my user always has 3 random options.
- As a developer, I want to track and store votes so that I can collect and analyze votes.
- As a developer, I want to smoothly render data to DOM with minimal errors.
- As a developer, I want to keep my code minimal, so that I don't run into errors.
- As a developer, I want to provide clear instructions on my page so that the user knows what to do.
- As a developer, I want to use a clean, legible design so that my users donâ€™t get pissed off
